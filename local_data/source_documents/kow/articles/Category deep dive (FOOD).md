The Category deep dive datastory has 4 pages you can navigate using buttons at the top of your screen:

1. **"Overview" page** enables you to assess the performance of your category, by comparings its performance this year to the same period of the previous year. It helps you identify which sales drivers are contributing most to this evolution.
2. **"Comparison" pag****e** enables you drill down the performance analysis to lower levels like brand type and brand and compare easily the different product groups on their main performance KPIs.
3. **"Online" page** enables you to assess the performance of the online channel and know its weight in your category's sales and customer base.
4. **"Top/Flop" page** enables you to identify at a glance which brands have a positive or negative impact on the category's performance

Each page of the datastory has filters on the right side to help you display what is relevant for your analysis:

* **Input set**, to choose the overall product universe of your analysis. The product attributes enabled for drill down will change depending on the input set chosen.
* **Attribute 01**, first level of product drill down, usually "Subcategory"
* **Attribute 02**, second level of product drill down, usually "Brand type"
* **Attribute 03**, third level of product drill down, usually "Brand"
* **Period**, to choose the time period of your analysis (last 12 months or year-to-month)

The filters are local, they only impact the datastory page they are displayed on. If you change page within the datastory, then the filters need to be set up again.

The store universe is fixed and has no drill down option.

The product attributes and the store universe are detailed in boxes right below the datastory's navigation buttons.
