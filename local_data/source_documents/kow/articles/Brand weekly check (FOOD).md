## When to use Brand weekly check

Brand weekly check is meant to quickly answer performance questions on recent weeks. It's a fairly simple datastory that focuses on critical performance KPIs and is automatically updated with the freshest data available.

It helps identify any significant change on the 4 key levers:

1. Distribution (KPI = Selling stores)
2. Assortment (KPI = Unique product sold)
3. Price (KPI = Price per unit)
4. Promotion (KPI =Share of promo sales)

It is also great to compare the dynamics of several brands or manufacturers.

## How to access Brand weekly check

The datastory can be accessed through the navigation pane on the left side of the screen in the "Business performance" topic.

The Brand weekly check datastory has 2 pages you can navigate using buttons at the top of your screen:

1. **"vs last year" page** enables you to assess the weekly performance of one product group by comparing its performance this year to the same weeks of the previous year
2. **"vs competition" pag****e** enables you to assess the weekly performance of one product group by comparing its performance to competing product groups' performance on the same weeks this year

Each page of the datastory has filters on the right side to help you display what is relevant for your analysis:

* **Competition universe filters**enable you to define the product group that will serve as 100% for all weight KPIs (like share of sales, share of units, share of customers)
  + **Input set**, to choose the overall product universe of your analysis. The product attributes enabled for drill down will change depending on the input set chosen.
  + **Attribute 01**, first level of product drill down, usually "Subcategory"
* **Product filters**enable you to define the focus product group that will be analyzed
  + **Attribute 02**, second level of product drill down, usually "Supplier"
  + **Attribute 03**, third level of product drill down, usually "Brand"

The filters are local, they only impact the datastory page they are displayed on. If you change page within the datastory, then the filters need to be set up again.

The **store** universe also changes depending on the input set chosen and has one drill down option, usually Store type.

The product attributes used in the input set are detailed in a box right below the datastory's navigation buttons.
