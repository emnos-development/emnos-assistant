# When to use Sales tree

**Sales tree** is an on-demand customer insight designed to help commercial teams evaluate product performance by looking at sales evolution and benchmarking across products.

It provides a **visual breakdown of sales**, allowing you to understand not just *how much* a product sold, but *why*—by analyzing the underlying customer behavior and identifying key sales drivers.

## When to use Sales tree

Use the Sales Tree report when you want to **assess the** **commercial performance** of a product over time. It compares sales between two time periods and benchmarks the results against other products.

This report is especially valuable for **customer-centric analysis**, as it highlights the **key drivers behind sales changes**—such as shifts in customer penetration, basket size, or purchasing frequency.

## How to request Sales tree

The **Sales Tree** report analyzes the sales change of a selected product between two time periods and breaks it down into its underlying KPIs.

To launch the report, click **"Start Request"** and follow the steps in the ordering wizard. You’ll need to define parameters across **four key dimensions**. All steps are required unless marked as optional:

* **Time period -**Select two time periods of equal length(in days) to compare sales performance.
* **Product universe -**Choose the group of products you want to analyze (e.g., Cola-based soft drinks).
* **Product analysis level** *(optional) -*Add a breakdown within your product universe to compare sub-groups (e.g., by Brand: Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Private Label). This enables performance comparison across these segments.
* **Store universe** *(optional) -*Define the store types to include (e.g., Supermarkets). By default, all stores are included and like-for-like comparison is not applied.
* **Customer universe** *(optional) -*Specify the customer segment to analyze (e.g., Frequent buyers). By default, all customers are included.
* **Promotion filter** *(optional) -*Choose whether to include or exclude promotional transactions (e.g., exclude promotions). By default, all transactions are considered.

## How to read Sales tree

#### Report structure

The Sales Tree report is structured across three interactive pages, accessible via buttons at the top of your screen:

1. On **"Sales & units" page,** analyze sales evolution from a customer-centric perspective with basket size and average price based on units.
2. On **"Sales & volume" pag****e,** explore sales evolution using volume-based metrics (e.g., KG or L) for basket size and average price.
3. On **"Summary table" page,** quickly compare all products within your defined product universe (e.g., split by Brand). This table is exportable to Excel for further analysis..

#### Understanding the Sales Decomposition Tree

![](images/1762783131635.png)

The first two pages visualize **sales breakdown from a customer-centric angle**:

* Sales (all customers) = Sales (non-members) + Sales (loyalty program members)
* Sales (loyalty program members) = Customers x Sales per customer
* Customers = Customer penetration (total stores) x Customers (total stores)
* Sales per customer = Baskets per customer x Sales per basket
* Sales per basket = Units per basket x Price per unit = Volume per basket x Price per volume

The KPIs with the most significant changes are the key drivers of product performance.

#### Benchmarking with Upper and Lower Trees

You can compare **two products simultaneously** using the **Upper Tree** and **Lower Tree** filters. This benchmarking helps you assess whether your focus product is outperforming or underperforming compared to similar products—and whether the underlying sales drivers are unique or shared.

Note: Filters are **local to each page**. If you switch pages, you’ll need to reapply the filters.

#### Viewing your analysis set up

To review all parameters used in your analysis, click the **"See Selected Parameters"** button at the top of the page.![](images/1762528323852.png)
