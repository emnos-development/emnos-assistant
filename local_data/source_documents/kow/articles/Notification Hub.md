#### **How to find your notifications**

You can access the notification hub at any time.

#### **Understanding the notifications page**

Clicking the link will take you to your notification hub. This page is designed to give you a clear overview of all your updates.

1. **Summary view:** At the top of the page, this section gives you a high-level overview of your updates. It shows the total number of notifications you have, grouped by type, such as 'Alerts to review' or 'Insights to Analyze'. This allows you to see at a glance exactly what kind of items are waiting for you.
2. **Notification feed:** The main section of the page is your feed. All notifications are listed here, with the most recent items at the top.

#### **Types of notifications**

Notification hub will alert you when a report you've requested is ready for analysis. You'll receive notifications for:

* **KPI exports:** Get an alert the moment your requested KPI export is complete and ready to download.
* **Customer insights:** Be notified as soon as your customer insight report has finished generating and is ready to explore.
* **Report failed:** You will also be alerted if a report has failed to generate, so you can start a new analysis.

#### **Interacting with notifications**

Each item in your feed gives you all the information you need at a glance.

* **Unread status:** A **blue dot** to the left of a notification means it's new and you haven't interacted with it yet.
* **Notification:** This section gives you a clear title and description of the update.
* **Linked object:** This shows the specific name of the report or file related to the notification.
* **Actions:** Click the **view icon** (the eye) to go directly to your completed report or to start downloading your KPI export file.

When you click anywhere in the notification, it will automatically be marked as read, and the blue dot will disappear.

When you click on the icons on the actions column ( "View" or "archive" icon) , the notification will be removed from the feed.
