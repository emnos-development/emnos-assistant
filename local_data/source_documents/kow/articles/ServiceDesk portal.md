# Creating a New Ticket

The Emnos Service Desk Portal offers a user-friendly interface for managing all support interactions. You can:

* **Create new support requests** (e.g., bugs, feature ideas, technical issues)
* **Track and manage existing tickets** (including older or closed ones)

To access the portal, visit:
<https://customer.servicedesk.emnos.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/2>
  
 (You must have an active Service Desk account. See [Service Desk Account](https://help.emnos.com/help/servicedesk-account) if you need help.)

## Creating a New Ticket

Once logged in, you will be presented with several request types. These help us route your ticket to the right team.

### Available Request Types:

* **Request Technical Support:**
    
   Use this when you can’t access the portal, encounter a broken service, or see inconsistent data.
* **Report a Bug:**
    
   For issues like app malfunctions, visual glitches, or calculation errors.
* **Suggest a New Feature:**
    
   Share an idea that could enhance your experience with Emnos products.
* **Suggest an Improvement:**
    
   Propose refinements to an existing feature or workflow.
* **Submit Other Questions:**
    
   For anything that doesn’t fit in the categories above — general inquiries, business clarifications, etc.

#### Required Fields for All Requests:

* **Summary:** A short, clear title of your request
* **Description:** Detailed explanation of the issue, idea, or question
* **Attachments (Optional):** Screenshots, documents, or examples that support your ticket

## Working with Existing Tickets

After submitting a request, you'll be taken to the ticket view. This page shows:

* The current status of your ticket
* Who is working on it
* Full communication history with timestamps
* Any files or attachments exchanged

All interactions — including those done via email — are fully visible here and stay synced.

### Accessing Your Tickets

You can return to your requests at any time by clicking your profile icon in the top-right corner and selecting **“Requests”** from the dropdown menu.

## System-Generated Tickets

In some cases, our backend systems will automatically create a Service Desk ticket on your behalf.

For example, when you request a report or KPI export through the Emnos Portal, our backend begins processing it. If an unexpected error or failure occurs during that process, our system:

* Automatically creates a ticket under your name (the logged-in user)
* Populates the summary and description with technical details of the issue
* Notifies our support team to investigate and follow up with you

These tickets will appear in your **Requests** view in the Service Desk Portal just like manually created tickets. You can track them, respond to our questions, or provide additional information if needed.

**Note:** These automated tickets are part of our commitment to proactive support — you don’t need to report backend processing failures manually.

## Tip

If you prefer email-based communication, you can still send updates or new information by replying to the ticket email thread — everything remains synced and visible inside the portal.
