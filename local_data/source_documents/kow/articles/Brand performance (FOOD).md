# When to use Brand performance

**Brand performance** is a pre-calculated datastory that enables commercial teams to assess the performance of their brand on a rolling year, from the beginning of the year or in the last 4 weeks. It also identifies the sales drivers and key levers contributing most to this performance. It is **updated every week**.

## When to use Brand performance

Brand performance allows you to analyze performance step by step from global KPIs to marketing key levers to detailed loyalty sales drivers for a thorough understanding of your brand's dynamics.

Your brand's performance is always analyzed in comparison to the subcategory's and category's performance to help you assess it's success.

Brand performance is also great to identify at a glance which brand had a positive or negative impact on the category's performance.

## How to access Brand performance

The datastory can be accessed through the navigation pane on the left side of the screen in the "Business performance" topic.

The Brand performance datastory has 3 pages you can navigate using buttons at the top of your screen:

1. **"Performance" page** enables you to assess the performance of your brand, by comparings its performance this year to the same period of the previous year and comparing this evolution to the subcategory's and category's change. It helps you identify which key lever has influenced this evolution (distribution, assortment, price or promo).
2. **"Sales tree" pag****e** enables you to identify the loyalty sales drivers that contributed most to your brand's performance evolution.
3. **"Top/Flop" page** enables you to identify at a glance which brands have a positive or negative impact on the category's performance.

Each page of the datastory has filters on the right side to help you display what is relevant for your analysis:

* **Competition universe filters**enable you to define the product group that will serve as 100% for all weight KPIs (like share of sales, share of units, share of customers)
  + **Input set**, to choose the overall product universe of your analysis. The product attributes enabled for drill down will change depending on the input set chosen.
  + **Attribute 01**, first level of product drill down, usually "Subcategory"
* **Product filters**enable you to define the focus product group that will be analyzed
  + **Attribute 02**, second level of product drill down, usually "Supplier"
  + **Attribute 03**, third level of product drill down, usually "Brand"

The filters are local, they only impact the datastory page they are displayed on. If you change page within the datastory, then the filters need to be set up again.

The **store** universe also changes depending on the input set chosen and has one drill down option, usually Store type.

The product attributes used in the input set are detailed in a box right below the datastory's navigation buttons.
