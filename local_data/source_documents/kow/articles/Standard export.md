# When to use Standard export

**Standard export** is an interface in the emnos platform for users to access and download pre-configured, standard data sets in one click. It provides different types of data sets based on each organization's license.

## When to use Standard export

Use the Standard export if you:

1. Need operational data out of the platform for reporting, analysis in Excel, or sharing with your team.
2. Want a simple "download" button to get the data without having to ask for help or learn a new technical tool.

This is a **standardized tool** used by multiple supplier partners. To maintain consistency across all users, emnos doesn't customize the Standard export datasets.

If you prefer getting data on specific dimension aggregates and using custom attributes, then KPI export is the feature you need.

## What data Standard export provides

Currently, Standard export provides 4 types of data sets to match different use cases and license packages:

1. **Brand benchmark monthly**, to analyze and compare the performance of each brand in your category
2. **My performance monthly**, to analyze the performance of your own products at EAN level
3. **Essential export  (monthly or weekly)**, to analyze the performance of all products in your category at EAN level
