The Category weekly check datastory has 3 pages you can navigate using buttons at the top of your screen:

1. **"vs last year" page** enables you to assess the weekly performance of one product group by comparings its performance this year to the same weeks of the previous year
2. **"vs competition" pag****e** enables you to assess the weekly performance of one product group by comparing its performance to competing product groups' performance on the same weeks
3. **"online" page** enables you to assess the weekly performance of the online channel and know its weight in your category's sales and customer base

Each page of the datastory has filters on the right side to help you display what is relevant for your analysis:

* **Input set**, to choose the overall product universe of your analysis. The product attributes enabled for drill down will change depending on the input set chosen.
* **Attribute 01**, first level of product drill down, usually "Subcategory"
* **Attribute 02**, second level of product drill down, usually "Brand type"
* **Attribute 03**, third level of product drill down, usually "Brand"

The filters are local, they only impact the datastory page they are displayed on. If you change page within the datastory, then the filters need to be set up again.

The store universe is fixed and has no drill down option.

The product attributes and the store universe are detailed in boxes right below the datastory's navigation buttons.
