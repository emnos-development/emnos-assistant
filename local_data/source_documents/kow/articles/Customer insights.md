## When to use Customer insights

All emnos Customer insights are use case specific and should be used to answer the following questions:

1. [Origin of sales](https://help.emnos.com/help/origin-of-sales "Origin of sales") = Figure out how much of your sales growth is positive for the category and how much is cannibalization. Or the reverse, figure out how much of your sales decrease is negative for the category.
2. [Origin of customers](https://help.emnos.com/help/origin-of-customers "Origin of customers") = Understand how much of your customer base is renewed and where customers come from and go to.
3. [Cross-purchase](https://help.emnos.com/help/cross-purchase "Cross-purchase") = Identify what portion of your customers are cross-purchasing 3 product groups, 2 product groups, or are exclusive to 1 product group
4. [Basket content](https://help.emnos.com/help/basket-content "Basket content") = Know how many units of your product are bought in one single basket, to optimize promo offers and packaging format
5. Sales tree = Analyze product performance by identifying key sales drivers and benchmarking across products.
6. Basket affinity = Discover which products are often bought in the same basket to identify cross-selling opportunities.

## How to use Customer insights

**To launch a Customer insight**, you need to select "New request" in the navigation pane and click on "Start request" in the card of the insight type you need.

The Customer insights ordering wizard will open. Follow directions to set up parameters for your request. All Customer insights need parameters set up on the same 4 dimensions (time period, product, store, customer) but each insight type has specificities. Please check each insight type's Help Center article for more details.

**To retrieve a previously launched Customer insight**, select "My customer insights" in the navigation pane. The Customer insights library will open. It displays all requests that you launched yourself, as well as the requests that have been shared with you by other users of the platform. The Customer insights library can be filtered by:

* insight type
* tags attached to requests
* requests creation date (yesterday, last week, last month)
* sharing status of requests (shared with me, owned by me)
* searched for a specific request name

## What functionalities does Customer insights have

* Re-use parameters from a previous Customer insight of the same type as a base for your new request
* Name your Customer insight
* Tag your Customer insight to identify it easily in the "My customer insights" library. For example, you can add a project name tag to all requests that are launched for a specific project and, later on, filter the library based on this tag to display only requests relevant for the project.
* Share the output with other users of the emnos platform that are part of your organization
