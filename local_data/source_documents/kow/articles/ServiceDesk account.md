# Important Distinction

To interact with the Emnos Customer Service Desk, you must have a dedicated **ServiceDesk account**. This account is **different** from your Emnos Portal account and is required to:

* Submit tickets via the portal
* Send support requests by email

## Important Distinction

The Emnos Service Desk account is actually an **Atlassian account** (used for products like Trello, JIRA, or Confluence). If you already have an Atlassian account with your company email, and you’ve been added to our customer list, you should be able to log in immediately.

**Note:** This account is not owned or managed by Emnos. It is provided by Atlassian and maintained by you. Emnos cannot reset your password or access your credentials. Please ensure you keep your login details safe and secure.

## How to Get Access

To have a proper ServiceDesk account, first you need to request access from your Emnos Contact Person, then you need to complete the signup form:

### 1. Request access via your emnos contact person

* Notify your Emnos contact person and request access
* They will add you to the customer list and trigger an invitation email
* The invitation email contains a unique link for completing your account setup

### 2. Complete the self registration by accepting the invitation

Please open your mailbox and then the email you received:

After successful registration, you’ll be able to log in to the [ServiceDesk Portal](/help/servicedesk-portal) or use [email](/help/servicedesk-email) to contact support.

### Logging into the ServiceDesk portal

You can try to login by following these steps:

1. Visit <https://servicedesk.emnos.com> (you will be automatically redirected to `https://customer.servicedesk.emnos.com`)
2. On the login page, you’ll see a prompt saying: *“Enter your email to log in or sign up”*
     
   *![](images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-173452.png)*
3. Enter your work email address and click **Next**
4. Provide your password and click **Next**, or you can request a reset anytime with *"Forgot password?"*, if you forgot your previously set password.
5. **If you see:**
     
   `We couldn't give you access. Use another email and try again.`
     
    then your email has not been added to our customer list yet. Please reach out to your Emnos contact person to enable access
