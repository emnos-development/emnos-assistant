# What is a datastory and an input set

The "**Datastory inputs**" feature enables Tenant Managers to maintain their organization's datastories relevant by modifying the parameters of the input sets computed for them.

## What is a datastory and an input set

A **datastory** is a pre-calculated analysis with a visual output, that is updated automatically by emnos. Currently, the platform contains following datastories:

* Category deep dive
* Category weekly check
* Brand performance
* Brand weekly check

An **input set** is the result dataset of an analysis that is fed to a datastory. It is defined by parameters on 4 dimensions (Time period, Products, Stores, Customers) as well as a selection of KPIs. The level of personalization allowed for each dimension's parameters depends on the datastory the input set is linked to.

## How to access Datastory inputs

The feature is available in the Platform management topic, in the navigation panel of the emnos platform, on the left side of the screen.

## How to use Datastory inputs

#### Creating a new input set for a datastory

The number of input sets computed for your organization depends on the contract we have signed. Contact your emnos account manager to add a new input set to a datastory. We will provide a competitive quote for the additional input you request.

#### Editing parameters of an existing input set

Identify the input set you wish to edit in the list of input sets available for your organization and click the "pen" icon.

Parameters of input sets can only be changed for the input sets your organization owns. You cannot change parameters for input sets shared with you by another organization. For example, an input set shared by a Retailer to a Supplier cannot be edited by the Supplier.

In the first step, you can change the product universe that will be analyzed by using the attribute filters. They work the same way as in KPI export.

Then, you can change the attributes used as analysis levels (i.e. filters) in your datastory. Be mindful that the order in which you select the attributes will correspond to the order of the filters in the datastory. The number of analysis levels depends on the type of datatsory.

The second step,  where the Store dimension's parameters can be personalized, only exists for some datastories. As in the first step, you can edit the store universe that will be analyzed and change the analysis level(s) for stores.

In the last step, you can define how volume should be measured in your datastory. It's either measured in Units with KPIs such as share of units, price per unit, units per baskets, or it's either measured in Volume (KG, L) with KPIs such as share of volume, price per volume, volume per basket.

You can also change the name of your input set.

Be aware, that all **changes you save will be refected in the next update** of your datastory. No immediate computation will be triggered.
