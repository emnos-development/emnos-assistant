# How It Works

If you have a ServiceDesk account attached to your e-mail address, you can contact the Emnos Customer Service Desk simply by sending an email to:

**servicedesk@emnos.com**

## How It Works

Sending an email to this address will automatically create a new support ticket in our system. You don’t need to log into the Service Desk Portal to initiate support — just send your message, and we’ll take it from there.

## Ticket Creation

* **Reporter:** The sender's email address will be recorded as the ticket reporter.
* **Summary:** The email’s subject line becomes the title of the ticket.
* **Description:** The body of your email becomes the ticket’s description.
* **Attachments:** Any images or documents attached to the email will be added to the ticket automatically.

## Ongoing Communication

All updates to your ticket will be sent to you via email. You’ll receive notifications when:

* Your ticket is received and created
* Someone picks up or starts working on your ticket
* We ask clarifying questions or request additional information
* The ticket status changes (e.g., In Progress, Resolved, Closed)

You can continue replying directly to these emails. Every response you send will be added to the ticket's internal conversation thread — ensuring full transparency and traceability.

## Tip

You can also view the full ticket and its status by logging into the [Service Desk Portal](/help/servicedesk-portal), using your Service Desk account.
