# Origin of customers

Origin of customers 
is an on-demand customer insight that enables commercial teams to understand how much of your products' or brand's customer base is renewed and where customers come from and go to.
When to use Origin of customers
Origin of customers is used to 
measure the number of new, lost and constant customers
 of a product or brand between 2 time periods. 
It is particularly interesting when 
analyzing the recruitement of a brand for its category
. The insight will show if your brand's new customers were already buying the category, or if your brand successfully recruited for the category as well. On the contrary, it will also show if the customers lost for your brand stopped buying the category altogether.
Origin of customers is also great to 
measure the sales impact of all these customer base changes
, especially the sales evolution of your constant customers. You will identify which sales drivers explain their change in spending between the 2 time periods analyzed.

How to read Origin of customers
Origin of customers has 3 pages you can navigate using buttons at the top of your screen:
"Overview" page
 enables you to understand how many of your products' customers are new, lost or constant. It shows the sales changes for the 3 customer groups and displays the sales drivers explaining these sales evolutions.
"Detailed flow" pag
e
 enables you to understand where customers come from and go to by replicating the analysis of "Overview" at a more detailed level. The New/Lost customers are divided further into 3 groups based on their purchasing behavior of the competition universe and all other products in store (i.e. total stores products). 
If your product has a customer increase in "New/lost to total stores", then it's benefitting from the overall attractiveness of the retailer.
If your product has a customer increase in "New/lost to competition", then it's recruiting for its competition universe. 
If you only have a customer increase in "New/lost to product" then your product is only recruiting for itself.
"Summary table" page
 enables you to compare at a glance all sales drivers values and evolution for all customer groups. You will also find information on Units and Volume changes for each customer group. This table can be exported to Excel.
All parameters set up for your request can be viewed by clicking on a dedicated button at the top of the page, called "See selected parameters":
